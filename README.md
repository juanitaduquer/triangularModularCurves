# triangularModularCurves
Enumerates triangular modular curves of low genus.

To run the code you need the Belyi repository at: https://github.com/jvoight/Belyi.
Also, download our code and attach the spec file:
AttachSpec("spec");

To enumerate curves X0(a,b,c;pp) of low genus, run:
ListBoundedGenusAdmissible(genus);

The file listsPrimeLowGenus contains lists of all triangular modular curves X_0(a,b,c;pp) and X_1(a,b,c;pp) of genus up to 2 with pp admissible for (a,b,c).
